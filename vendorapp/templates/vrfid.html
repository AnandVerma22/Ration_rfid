                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) refers to a wireless
                            system comprised of two components: tags and readers. The reader is a device that has one or
                            more antennas that emit radio waves and receive signals back from the RFID tag. Tags, which
                            use radio waves to communicate their identity and other information to nearby readers, can
                            be passive or active. Passive RFID tags are powered by the reader and do not have a battery.
                            Active RFID tags are powered by batteries.

                            RFID tags can store a range of information from one serial number to several pages of data.
                            Readers can be mobile so that they can be carried by hand, or they can be mounted on a post
                            or overhead. Reader systems can also be built into the architecture of a cabinet, room, or
                            building.</p>

                        <div class="entry-meta mb-3">

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Every RFID system consists of three components: a scanning
                            antenna, a transceiver and a transponder. When the scanning antenna and transceiver are
                            combined, they are referred to as an RFID reader or interrogator. There are two types of
                            RFID readers -- fixed readers and mobile readers. The RFID reader is a network-connected
                            device that can be portable or permanently attached. It uses radio waves to transmit signals
                            that activate the tag. Once activated, the tag sends a wave back to the antenna, where it is
                            translated into data.</p>
